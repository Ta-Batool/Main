## The purpose of Api:
The purpose of the Weather API is to provide users with reliable and real-time weather information, including:
1.	Weather Forecasting: Users can access forecasts for upcoming weather conditions in specific locations.
2.	Alerts: The API delivers alerts for severe weather events, helping users stay informed and safe.
3.	Current Weather Data: Users can retrieve real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, and other relevant metrics.
4.	Air Quality Information: The API provides data on air quality, allowing users to understand environmental conditions that may affect health and well-being.
## Dependencies:
•	flask, requests, python
•	Pip install flask
•	Pip install request
## Testing:
1.	Initialization: The Flask application was started by executing the command python app.py in the terminal. This initialized the API and made it ready to accept requests.
2.	Input Testing: Various city names were input directly into the terminal as part of the testing process. This included both valid and random city names to evaluate the API's response and error handling.
3.	Response Evaluation: For valid city names, the API was expected to return the current weather data, including parameters such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
For invalid city names, the API was expected to return an appropriate error message, indicating that the city could not be found.
4.	Observations: The responses from the API were observed for correctness and completeness, ensuring that the data returned matched the requested city.
5.	Outcome: The testing confirmed that the API was functioning correctly for valid inputs and appropriately handling errors for invalid inputs.
